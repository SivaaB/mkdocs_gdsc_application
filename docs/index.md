Welcome Team,

We're thrilled to have you on the official GDSC BITS Dubai Chapter Standards and Procedures Page. This space is all about guiding how things work within our club in a clear and organized way.

Our goal is to make sure that everyone understands how we do things, so we've put together a set of guidelines. Think of these guidelines like a roadmap – they show us the best path to follow for smooth and successful club activities.

As we start this journey together, let's all stick to these standards and procedures. They're like the building blocks that help us create a strong and successful community. 

Best Regards,   
Sivaa B 👨🏽‍💻
