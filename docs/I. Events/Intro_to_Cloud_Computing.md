## 🚀 Workshop Outline

**The workshop will consist of the following sections:**

1. Introduction to Cloud Computing
    - Overview of cloud computing and its importance: 
        - Cloud Computing is defined as the practice of using remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage and process data rather than using a local. 
    - Benefits and challenges of adopting cloud services.
