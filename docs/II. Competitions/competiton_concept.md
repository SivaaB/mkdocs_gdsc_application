# üí° College Innovators' Challenge: Enhancing Campus Life 
---
## üéØ **Objective**
-  To address common challenges and improve the overall college experience for students. 
- The problems identified need not be within BPDC.

## üìã **Format**

- **Problem Identification:** Participants would be encouraged to identify and analyze common problems faced by college students in their daily lives. These problems could be related to academic life, campus resources, student engagement, mental health, physical well-being (health insurance), and transportation.

- **Solution Design:** Participants would form teams (max 4) and work together to design innovative technology solutions that address the identified problems. The solutions could leverage mobile applications, web platforms, chatbots, etc. These solutions need not be limited to the "tech" space. It could be a simple pitch that states the problem and a viable solution. Having a working prototype would fetch teams extra points; it's not mandatory. As long as a feasible solution with proof-of-concept is demonstrated, it is acceptable.

- **Pitch and Presentation:** Finalists would present their solutions to a panel of judges, which could include representatives from Google, college administration, technology companies, and ex-Student Council members. The presentations would highlight the problem statement, solution concept, user research, key features, and potential impact on college life.

## üèÜ **Result**

- **Evaluation and Feedback:** The judges would evaluate the solutions based on criteria such as innovation, usability, feasibility, scalability, and potential benefits for college students. They would provide constructive feedback to participants, encouraging them to refine their ideas and consider real-world implementation.

- **Awards and Recognition:** Winners would be selected based on the judges' evaluations, and awards would be given to the top-performing teams. The awards could include recognition, cash prizes, mentorship, internships, or potential partnerships to further develop and implement their solutions.

## üöÄ **What's Next?**
- **Implementation and Collaboration Opportunities:** The competition organizers could collaborate with the college administration, relevant student organizations, and local technology companies to explore opportunities for implementing the winning solutions on campus. This could involve piloting the solutions, securing funding or resources, or establishing partnerships to bring the ideas to life.
